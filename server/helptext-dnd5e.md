## Functionality specific to DnD 5e
- **Advantage/disadvantage:**
  As a special shortcut, `dXa` means `2dXk1`, and `dXd` means `2dXkl1`.
  For example, `/roll d20a`:
- **Stats:**
  Use `/roll stats` to roll stats for a DnD 5e character (`4d6d1` 6 times).
- **Death save:**
  Use `/roll death save` to roll a death save for DnD 5e.
- ** Roll comment:**
  For (sub)expressions that only use one d20 dice, display a comment for NAT 1 and NAT 20.
